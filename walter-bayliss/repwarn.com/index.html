			<p>My name’s Walt Bayliss, and I’d like to give you some money.</p>
			<p>Right now, on this page, you have the chance to start your own almost completely done-for-you business.</p>
			<p>Soon, you’ll be able to provide a service offline businesses want so much, they’ll be beating a path to your door.   <span class="bb">Even if you’ve never made an offline sale before in your life.</span></p>
			<p>It doesn’t matter if they’re hotels, restaurants, chiropractors, opticians, mechanics, shops or bars.  They will want it, and they will be happy to pay you $97/month for it.</p>
			<p>(I can guarantee that, because they’re already paying me that much for the exact same service I’m about to show you.)</p>
			<ul>
				<span><em>And that means:</em></span>
				<li>If you’re already offering services to offline clients, this will give you a COMPLETELY HANDS-FREE new string to your bow</li>
				<li>If you want to break into the offline market, this is the single easiest place to start.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4 class="text-center bb">And the best part of all?</h4>			
			<p>It takes you absolutely no time or effort to deliver.  In fact, your clients will do everything, but they’ll still be paying you for the privilege.</p>
			<p>One more thing: don’t worry.  This isn’t going to be one of those ‘blind’ letters where I never actually reveal any info.  I’m going to go through everything in detail, right now.</p>
			<h4 class="text-center bb">Let’s get started.</h4>

			<h1 class="text-center bb">Every business knows how important<br/>it is to <span class="red">keep track of what people<br/>say about them online</span></h1>
			<div class="row no-margin">
			<p>(After all, read 5 good reviews and 1 bad one for a<br/>restaurant, it’ll be the bad one that sticks with you…)</p>
			<p>And that’s the core of reputation management.</p>
			<p>Usually, if you offer a reputation management<br/> service, you’ll be given a list of terms by the business,<br/>and it’s your job to keep track of them online.</p>
			<p>So when they appear in reviews or blog posts, you<br/> keep a record and then send it to your client.</p>
			<p>The problem is, for most of these businesses, it’s too late.<br/>The damage has been done.</p>
			</div>
			<h1 class="text-center bb">Businesses don’t want a service that warns them of bad reviews a week too late… <span class="red">FAR outside the window of opportunity for action</span></h1>

	<section>
		<center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/sec2.png"></center>
		<div class="container">
			<p>Now, imagine how happy your clients would be if you could offer them response times like that?
			Thing is, Qantas has the resources to do that.  They had 4 people scanning social media full time.  Until now, that’s been something out of reach of smaller businesses.
			(Not to mention out of reach of the usual reputation management services… after all, can you afford to spend every waking minute scanning the web for just one client?)
			</p>
			<h1 class="text-center leap bb">But now, thanks to you, businesses<br/>will be able <span class="red">to LEAP onto bad reviews within<br/> MINUTES and rescue their reputations</span></h1>
			<p>You’ll give them the ability to find bad reviews instantly.  The ability to take control of the situation.  The ability to turn what could have been a PR nightmare into a massive coup, delivering more sales and more customers.</p>
			<h4 class="text-center bb">And you’ll do it all without lifting a finger.</h4>
			<p>Now, this may sound too good to be true.  And if you’re thinking there’s a catch then, well, you’re right..</p>
			<p><strong>Let me explain how it works:</strong></p>

		<center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/sec3.png"></center>	
		<div class="container">
			<p>Recently, I launched a new tool called RepWarn.</p>
			<p>And let me say right now, it’s a high-end product.  It’s being sold as a $97/month software-as-a-service (and I’ll be explaining shortly how you can get in on that action).</p>
			<p>And when you’ve got a RepWarn account, reputation management becomes a whole lot easier.  <strong>Here’s how it works:</strong></p>

				<li><img class="img" src="assets/img/c3.png"><span class="red bb">Whenever someone mentions your keyword</span> – whether it’s in a Facebook post, review, blog post or tweet – you’ll be e-mailed INSTANTLY with the comment text and a direct link to the post</li>

			<p>Now you may think I’m about to say that you should use RepWarn to create the notifications you send to clients.  And sure, that’d make delivering a reputation management service much easier.</p>
			<p>But this isn’t about offering you RepWarn as a product.</p>
			<p>It’s about offering you RepWarn as a BUSINESS.</p>
			<h1 class="text-center bb">This is your EXCLUSIVE chance to get<br/>Reseller Rights to RepWarn… <span class="red">and take<br/>charge of your very own hands-free business</span></h1>
			<p>With these reseller rights, you can sell RepWarn to your clients for $97/month, and keep 100% of the profit.</p>

			<h2 class="text-center red bb">So what are these Reseller Rights going to cost?</h2>
			<p>You might well expect that rights like these to a product which is priced at $97/month to be expensive.</p>
			<p>So I’d like to make clear, right now, that these rights are not going to break the bank.</p>
			<p>In fact, even at full price they’ll be significantly cheaper than a single licence of the RepWarn service, and you might be lucky enough to pick up an early-bird discount too.</p>
			<h2 class="text-center red bb">And you’ll be given everything you need<br/><span class="red">to start making sales from day 1</span></h2>
			<h4 class="text-center leap bb">Now, let’s be clear:</h4>
			<p>We don’t dictate any terms on how you sell RepWarn to your customers.</p>
			<p>(Well… there’s all the usual ‘don’t spam’ stuff, but RepWarn delivers such a valuable service that if you have to resort to tactics like that, frankly you’re not going to get far in business anyhow…)</p>
			<p>But to give you the best possible start, we’ve put together a ton of ready-made sales material to make sure you can get up and running as fast as possible.</p>
			<center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/sec6.png"></center>
			<h4 class="text-center bb">But if you thought that was good, just wait until you see this…</h4>
			<h2 class="text-center bb">Reseller Rights Bonus:<br/><span class="red">A FREE copy of Social Lead Geyser, worth $197</span></h2>
			<p>Included with your reseller rights, you’ll be given a copy of Social Lead Geyser.
			<p>This software was developed to make finding offline leads easier than finding a crook in Congress.
			<p>All you need to do is pick the kind of business you want to find and (if you like) a location.  Social Lead Geyser will hunt out the tip leads for you to target, and even provide you with some quality approach e-mails to break the ice.  Trust me, it beats cold calling</p>

	<section id="section9">
		
			<center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/sec7.png"></center>
		<div class="container">
			<p>And of course, there’s no restrictions on how you use Social Lead Geyser.  So you won’t just have a load of leads for RepWarn… you can have new leads for any other service you choose to offer as well.</p>
			<p>No lengthy searches, no trawling through the phone book.  Just type in your keywords and the software does the rest.</p>
			<p>Most people have to pay $197 to use Social Lead Geyser <span class="blue bb">(you can check out the website here)</span> but for you, it’s all part of the package.</p>
			<h1 class="text-center red bb">You can profit as a RepWarn Reseller<br/>whether you’ve already got offline clients or<br/>if you’re starting completely from scratch</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>If you’ve already got clients,</strong>  they’re going to love your new service.  Just direct them to one of the minisites and get them signed up.</p>
					<p>Just think about this… if you could tell all your clients that they never have to worry about bad reviews again, would they be interested?</p>
					<p>And when you pair an awesome service like this with your authority as a trusted provider, I’m confident you’ll find RepWarn the easiest sale you’ve ever made.</p>
					
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>If you’re just starting out,</strong>  RepWarn gives you the best possible springboard: a service that’s guaranteed to generate interest and a completely hands-free business for you.</p>
					<p>And with all the sales material ready-made for you, you don’t even need to spend time on the marketing – you can get up and running right away.</p>

			<h1 class="text-center bb"><span class="red">Our angle</span> (yes, we’ve got one…)</h1>
			<p>Now, as I mentioned earlier, there is a catch. </p>
			<p>And you might well be wondering why we’re offering such a good deal on these reseller rights (like keeping 100% of all the profit you earn).</p>
			<h4 class="bb">It’s simply this:</h4>
			<p>As we mentioned earlier, we’re out to make RepWarn a global brand.  For that, we need exposure.  If you can help us get that exposure, we’re happy to pay you a premium.</p>
			<p>And frankly, the market for reputation management is huge.  Not only is there more than enough room for all of us, but you’ll reach people we never could.</p>
			<p>This way, we get more exposure, you get a steady income stream.  Everyone’s a winner.</p>
			<h1 class="text-center red bb">Here’s your part of the bargain</h1>
			<p>Since we’re dealing with all the customer support, paying for all the hosting and supporting all the technology, there are a few running costs.</p>
			<p>So these rights aren’t free.</p>
			<p>But they are extremely good value.  All we ask is a small contribution to keep the customer support and tech teams online – just $67/month.</p>
			<p>That means as soon as you make one sale, you’re getting steady beer money.  Land ten sales, and you’ll be making $903 month after month after month.</p>
			<p>Even if you take the whole time off and spend it camped out in front of the TV.</p>
			<p>(This also means that if you cancel the subscription – which you’re free to do, at any time – you won’t receive any further commissions.   Please note: this isn’t for someone who plans to bank commissions but avoid their part of the deal.  Jerks like that are not welcome here.)</p>
			<h1 class="text-center red bb">And if you move fast you can<br/>get an even better deal</h1>
			<p>To make this an extra-special deal for Warriors, anyone who moves fast will make even more money from the same number of sales.</p>
		</div>
		<center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/img7.png"></center>
		<div class="container">
			<p>With just 1 sale under your belt, you’ll be turning a profit.  With 10, you’ve got a profitable sideline.  With 50, you’re getting significantly more than the average American income.</p>
			<p>And of course, if you’re already active offline, you’ll never find another service that’s so easy to add to your client offer.</p>
			<p>You can be ready to start in just a few minutes.  Push the button below, and your Reseller Licence will be sent to you immediately, along with all the sales materials:</p>

		<center><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/img2.png"></center>
		<div class="container">
			<p>You’re just one click away from providing your customers with an exceptionally valuable service – maybe the most valuable service.</p>
			<p>At best, a bad review left unchecked will cause damage to their reputation.  At worst, it’ll break their business.</p>
			<p>Imagine for a minute what it’ll be like to not only be paid every month for doing virtually nothing…</p>
			<p>(And of course, after your clients are signed up it’s LITERALLY nothing – we deal with everything from that point on)</p>
			<p>But to have your clients know that thanks to you, they’re still in business and their livelihoods are safe.</p>
			<p>To make that a reality, all you need to do is push the button now:</p>
		</div>
		<center><a href="#"><img class="img-responsive" src="assets/img/img3.png"></a></center>
		<div class="container">
			<p>On behalf of everyone at RepWarn, thank you for reading this letter.  I look forward to sending you your first commissions.</p>

			<p>Providing a service that offline businesses desperately WANT and NEED…</p>
			<p>And building up a regular, recurring income in the process.</p>
